========================================
Burial plot map - system based on row & column

Overall the layout is 16 rows x 16 columns.
There are a number of exceptions.
1- There are grave sites along west, north and east walls.
2- some rows are shorter due to central cross monument.
3- cemetery narrows at the top, north end, so many rows are shorter
4- some rows have urn burial sites which are smaller.

Use the 16x16 grid as the base system. If a row has more sites, add -A, -B suffixes etc.
If a row has fewer, create dummy plots and state that they are not real plots.

Odd numbered rows have stones that face south. Photos of those stone face north.
Even numbered rows have stones that face north. Photos of those stone face south.

========================================


East Wall-
S->N
about 25 plots

West Wall-
S-> N
about 30 plots

North Wall-
about 16 plots, same pattern as center area.

Row 14 east side-
some plots not aligned with row 13. Perhaps 2 half width plots in 14.

Row 15 & 16-
On east side, row 15 
no site at either 1 or 2
3 to 7 are set up as Urn burial plots about 1/3 the width
The urn sites are half the length and are setup as double sided.
So even though there is no real row 16 on east side, call them row 15A

Rows 5 & 6-
do not have plots in cols 8 & 9
cross in center takes up space

Rows 7 and above-
 do not have plots in cols 1 & 16

Row 10 east side-
has smaller plots, pre-defined with concrete boarders.
Use numbering
10-09 to 10-11   normal plots
for 10-12-10-15  use A and B



1995 Photos
in 1995, Richard Otter visited the Oberschwarzach cemetery in July 1995, accompanied by Doris Lehmann geb. Niewdermaier.
This sampling of grave marker inscriptions was not done systematically. 
Markers with names that were deemed familiar were photographed. 
The photographs were transcribed into this list on June 2010.
